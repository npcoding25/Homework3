# Password Generator

## Objective

* To create a website that gives you a randomly generated password based on the criteria you ask for.

## Functionality

When you go on the webpage you will be asked a series of questions.
  * How many characters do you want?
  * Do you want special characters?
  * Do you want numbers?
  * Do you want uppercase letters?
  * Do you want lowercase letters?

After choosing your selected characters you can click on the 'Generate Password' button. This will give you a password with all your selected criteria.

### Challenges

There were many obstacles on the way to make the password generator work. I over thought the functions and I was making it way more work then it needed to be. I wanted the questions to come up after i pressed the button so I tried putting everything inside the 'writePassword()' but i kept getting errors and could not get it to work.
